Here is a histogram of the poisson distribution:

```{r cars, fig.cap="my caption"}
hist(rpois(100,3))
```

The thing below is a table:

```{r}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "I need this to be the third thing that appears. But it comes out first???")
```

The thing below is a bigger table:

```{r}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:6, 1:6], caption = "I need this to be the fourth thing that appears. But it comes out second???")
```
